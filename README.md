## Laser Cut

We made an appointment with the [Cleveland Public Library Makerspace](http://www.cpl.org/TheLibrary/TechCentral/TechCentralMakerSpace.aspx) to print and cut the acrylic we ordered from [McMaster-Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/#acrylic-sheets/=wqk3t6).

See the pdf of the cube design we had printed: [cube cut](https://github.com/make-on-the-lake/LED_Cube/blob/master/LED%20CUbe.pdf)

## Credits

This was a fun project that I orrigonally found at: [instructables.com](http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Cube-Night-Light/). Our version was modified to be laser cut and have more controll with a better switch.
